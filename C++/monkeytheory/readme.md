This program is the same as the one I wrote in python, but I converted it to c++ when I took the c++ course in 2023

Why: Because I saw a meme about the following theory, and wanted to make a python program based on it
-- The infinite monkey theorem states that if you let a monkey hit the keys of a typewriter at random an infinite amount of times, eventually the monkey will type out the entire works of Shakespeare

What it does:

- Gets a goal word from the user
- Generates random strings until it generates the goal word/string
- Scores each generated string, and prints each string that is closer to the goal than the previous best
