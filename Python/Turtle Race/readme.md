Why: I wanted to make a game that me and my friends could just watch

When: 2023, on a random saturday while at a friends house, created in about 30 minutes

How: Through the use of custom functions, and the time, random, and turtle python modules

What it does:

- draws the screen, including the race track, finish line, and racing turtles
- loops the following until a turtle has reached the finish line:
  - checks if turtle is on an edg of the track, if it is, 'bounces' it back inwards
  - randomly chooses a turtle
  - randomly turns the turtle will left or right 5 degrees
  - moves the turtle 5 pixels forwards
- once a turtle has passed the finish line, displays a message with the winning turtle's name
- allows the user to reset the race
